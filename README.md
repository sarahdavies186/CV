## Skills

#### Adaptable

Immersing myself in different environments and cultures has become second nature to me. Living and working in 5 different countries over the past 10 years pushed me out of my comfort zone and into a whole new world, working in small rural villages to sprawling high-tech cities. Encountering a variety of cultural differences plus language barriers meant I had to use initiative to find new ways of working together through diversity, using the benefits of these situations to create a positive impact.

#### Communication

With a commitment to learn from those around me and work together to help one another, communication has been a key aspect for many of my job roles. Whilst working at the Princes Trust, I had to change methods of communication depending on the audience, whether this was young people, colleagues, delivery partners, referral agencies or key funders. Working with a variety of people across companies greatly increased my ability to communicate with different teams, and find a way to work together effectively.

#### Problem Solving

During my time studying at Makers Academy I learnt something new every day. This also meant plenty of problem solving and looking at a given challenge in a different way. Through multiple individual and group projects, I was able to really build upon my problem solving skills whilst also learning from those around me. 

An example of this is a project where we had to create a social media app similar to facebook, using the mern stack. As this was something I hadn't worked with before, I spent time diagramming and trying to understand the basics of how the programme worked, which helped build my foundational understanding. During the process of building the program we encountered many problems, but by working together, taking our time, regular breaks, debugging and making use of the resources we had available, we were able to work through the problems.

#### Teamwork

Through my previous job roles and experience, I have worked within many different teams and positively worked together towards a common goal. Most recently at Makers, I have spent most days working either as part of a team or pair programming. This has really allowed me to work on my coding process and learn together and from others. 

#### Creative

Coming from a design background gives me a unique perspective and has allowed me to also use previous experience with software such Adobe PS, AI, XD, ID and figma. This has allowed me to collaborate on the design process of projects, and create a tailored experience for the user.
